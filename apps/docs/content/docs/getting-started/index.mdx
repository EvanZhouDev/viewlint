## Prerequisites

- Install [Bun](https://bun.sh) (the ViewLint CLI runs on Bun).
- Expect a one-time Playwright browser download the first time you install ViewLint.

## Quick Start

Install and configure ViewLint with this command:

```bash tab="NPM"
npm init @viewlint/config@latest
```

```bash tab="PNPM"
pnpm create @viewlint/config@latest
```

```bash tab="Bun"
bun create @viewlint/config@latest
```

```bash tab="Yarn"
yarn create @viewlint/config
```

That creates a `viewlint.config.ts` for you. It looks like this:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: {
    rules,
  },
  extends: ["rules/recommended"],
});
```

## Run ViewLint

Start with a single URL:

```bash tab="NPM"
npx viewlint https://example.com
```

```bash tab="PNPM"
pnpm dlx viewlint https://example.com
```

```bash tab="Bun"
bunx viewlint https://example.com
```

```bash tab="Yarn"
yarn dlx viewlint https://example.com
```

When you’re ready, move on to:
