description: Help Agents write UI with ViewLint
---

The ViewLint MCP server lets an AI agent run ViewLint as a tool.

It's useful when you want the agent to get fast feedback from the _rendered page_ while it's building UI. Instead of guessing, the agent can lint a URL and use the results to guide its next change.

If you are new to MCP, see [their website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) for more information.

## Run the server

The `stdio` MCP server is published as `@viewlint/mcp`.

```bash
npx @viewlint/mcp@latest
```

You can also start it from the ViewLint CLI:

```bash
viewlint --mcp
```

If `npx @viewlint/mcp@latest` is unavailable in your current registry, this CLI path still works when the local MCP package is present.

## Configure your editor

Most MCP-capable editors accept a `command` + `args` configuration.

Example for VS Code (`.vscode/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "viewlint": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@viewlint/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

### `lint`

Lints one or more URLs with ViewLint.

Required input:

- `urls`: `string[]`

Optional input:

- `configFile`: `string` path to a `viewlint.config.*` file
- `view`: named view from config
- `options`: named option layers from config
- `scopes`: named scopes from config
- `selectors`: ad-hoc CSS selectors used as scope roots
- `quiet`: if true, return only error-level messages

When `configFile` is omitted, ViewLint uses config discovery starting from the server’s working directory.

### `get-config`

Discovers and returns the ViewLint config path from the server’s working directory upward.

Input:

- `configFile` (Optional): `string` path if you want to explicitly specify one

Use this tool first when you are unsure which config will be used for linting.
