description: Help Agents write UI with ViewLint
---

The ViewLint MCP server lets an AI agent run ViewLint as a tool.

It's useful when you want the agent to get fast feedback from the _rendered page_ while it's building UI. Instead of guessing, the agent can lint a URL and use the results to guide its next change.

If you are new to MCP, see [their website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) for more information.

## Run the server

The `stdio` MCP server is published as `@viewlint/mcp`.

```bash
npx @viewlint/mcp@latest
```

You can also start it from the ViewLint CLI:

```bash
viewlint --mcp
```

## Configure your editor

Most MCP-capable editors accept a `command` + `args` configuration.

Example for VS Code (`.vscode/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "viewlint": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@viewlint/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

### `lint-urls`

Lints one or more URLs.

This tool is intentionally simple: it always uses the Default View and treats each URL as a Target with `baseURL` set.

Input:

- Urls (Required): `string[]`
- ConfigFile (Optional): `string` path to a `viewlint.config.*` file

When `configFile` is omitted, ViewLint uses config discovery starting from the server’s working directory.
