## What is ViewLint?

ViewLint helps identify issues with your UI, by analyzing the rendered output a human sees, instead of code.

Built from the start [for coding agents](#built-for-llms), ViewLint accelerates workflows from development to shipping. It's designed to be ready out-of-the-box as well as extensible, making it perfect for individual developers to enterprise organizations.

## The UI Linting Problem

In the world of UI, identifying issues with code can only get you so far. Many issues are incredibly difficult if not impossible to catch just by looking at code alone:

* Contents overflowing containers
* Poor text contrast
* Obscured hit targets

So instead, ViewLint validates your UI the same way a human does, looking at the raw rendered browser output to identify any potential issues.

## Built for LLMs

LLMs are fantastic at writing code.
They're not so great at making UI.

That's because when programming, they are able to get live feedback from a linter about issues.
When making UI, they're only choice is to manually inspect the HTML or by taking a screenshot. In both cases, the LLM rarely catches any issues.

With ViewLint, we close the feedback loop and allow LLMs to get live feedback on their UIs as well, improving their performance significantly.
