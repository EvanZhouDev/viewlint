## What is ViewLint?

ViewLint helps identify issues with your UI, by analyzing the rendered output a human sees, instead of code.

Built from the start [for coding agents](#built-for-llms), ViewLint accelerates workflows from development to shipping. It's designed to be ready out-of-the-box as well as extensible, making it perfect for individual developers to enterprise organizations.

## The UI Linting Problem

In the world of UI, identifying issues with code can only get you so far. Many issues are incredibly difficult if not impossible to catch just by looking at code alone:

- Contents overflowing containers
- Poor text contrast
- Obscured hit targets

So instead, ViewLint validates your UI the same way a human does, looking at the actual rendered browser output to identify any potential issues.

### UI's Broken Feedback Loop

LLMs are fantastic at writing code. They're not so great at making UI.

As it turns out, it's because coding agents have a closed feedback loop to validate their code and logic. However, when designing UIs, the agent can only inspect the DOM tree manually or take screenshots, both of which give it weak feedback that doesn't create a strong feedback loop to help it improve its output.

### ViewLint Closes the Loop

With ViewLint, we close the feedback loop with UI design, and allow the agent to get live feedback on the rendered output of the website it is working on. This significantly improves their UI design performance. Compare the same UI created with and without ViewLint by dragging the slider below.

## Core Ideas

- ViewLint lints rendered pages, not source code.
- A lint run is defined by a _Target_ (a View + options + an optional scope), not by a URL.
- On the CLI, passing a URL is the easy path: it just becomes a Target with `baseURL` set.

If you want the deeper model, start with [Configure Views](/docs/configure-viewlint/configure-views) and [Configure Scope](/docs/configure-viewlint/configure-scope).
