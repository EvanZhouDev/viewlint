ViewLint rules run on the **rendered page** (not your source code).

This page documents the rules shipped in `@viewlint/rules`.

## Use the built-in rules

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: {
    rules,
  },
  extends: ["rules/recommended"],
});
```

Related: [Configure Rules](/docs/configure-viewlint/configure-rules)

If you’re not sure where to start, keep `rules/recommended` enabled and only override rules when you have a clear reason.

## Presets

### `rules/recommended`

The `rules/recommended` preset is the default starting point. It focuses on high-signal issues that usually indicate real bugs or strong UX problems.

It enables:

- Rule `rules/hit-target-obscured` (Error)
- Rule `rules/clipped-content` (Error)
- Rule `rules/container-overflow` (Error)
- Rule `rules/overlapped-elements` (Error)
- Rule `rules/text-overflow` (Error)
- Rule `rules/text-contrast` (Warn)
- Rule `rules/unexpected-scrollbar` (Error)

### `rules/all`

The `rules/all` preset is useful when you want more feedback while polishing a UI. It includes everything in `rules/recommended`, plus:

- Rule `rules/corner-radius-coherence` (Warn)
- Rule `rules/misalignment` (Warn)
- Rule `rules/space-misuse` (Warn)
- Rule `rules/text-proximity` (Warn)
- Rule `rules/text-ragged-lines` (Warn)

## Rule reference

All rules in `@viewlint/rules` currently take **no options**. If a rule reports an issue, you fix the UI; if you need to suppress something intentionally, use `data-viewlint-ignore`.

### `rules/hit-target-obscured`

Detects interactive elements that are significantly covered by another element (hard to click).

### `rules/clipped-content`

Detects content clipped by `overflow: hidden` / `overflow: clip`.

### `rules/container-overflow`

Detects elements that overflow their parent container.

### `rules/overlapped-elements`

Detects layout overlaps between large, normal-flow elements.

### `rules/unexpected-scrollbar`

Detects small “almost invisible” scrollbars (usually a 1–20px overflow bug).

### `rules/text-overflow`

Detects text that visually extends outside its container.

### `rules/text-contrast`

Detects low-contrast text using screenshot-based sampling.

### `rules/corner-radius-coherence`

Detects nested corner radii that look visually inconsistent.

### `rules/misalignment`

Detects sibling elements in flex layouts that look like they were meant to align but are slightly off.

### `rules/space-misuse`

Detects containers with irregular or wasteful empty space around content.

### `rules/text-proximity`

Detects horizontally adjacent text blocks that are too close together.

### `rules/text-ragged-lines`

Detects awkward ragged/widowed lines in multi-line text blocks.

## Suppressing rules

To ignore a subtree of the DOM, use `data-viewlint-ignore`:

```html
<div data-viewlint-ignore="rules/text-contrast">...</div>
```

Use `data-viewlint-ignore="all"` to suppress all rules inside that subtree.
