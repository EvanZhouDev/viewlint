ViewLint rules run on the **rendered page** (not your source code).

This page documents the rules shipped in `@viewlint/rules`.

## Use the built-in rules

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: {
    rules,
  },
  extends: ["rules/recommended"],
});
```

## Presets

### `rules/recommended`

Enabled by default in the quick start:

- `rules/hit-target-obscured` (error)
- `rules/clipped-content` (error)
- `rules/container-overflow` (error)
- `rules/overlapped-elements` (error)
- `rules/text-overflow` (error)
- `rules/text-contrast` (warn)
- `rules/unexpected-scrollbar` (error)

### `rules/all`

Everything in `recommended`, plus:

- `rules/corner-radius-coherence` (warn)
- `rules/misalignment` (warn)
- `rules/space-misuse` (warn)
- `rules/text-proximity` (warn)
- `rules/text-ragged-lines` (warn)

## Rule reference

All rules in `@viewlint/rules` currently take **no options**.

### `rules/hit-target-obscured`

Detects interactive elements that are significantly covered by another element (hard to click).

### `rules/clipped-content`

Detects content clipped by `overflow: hidden` / `overflow: clip`.

### `rules/container-overflow`

Detects elements that overflow their parent container.

### `rules/overlapped-elements`

Detects layout overlaps between large, normal-flow elements.

### `rules/unexpected-scrollbar`

Detects small “almost invisible” scrollbars (usually a 1–20px overflow bug).

### `rules/text-overflow`

Detects text that visually extends outside its container.

### `rules/text-contrast`

Detects low-contrast text using screenshot-based sampling.

### `rules/corner-radius-coherence`

Detects nested corner radii that look visually inconsistent.

### `rules/misalignment`

Detects sibling elements in flex layouts that look like they were meant to align but are slightly off.

### `rules/space-misuse`

Detects containers with irregular or wasteful empty space around content.

### `rules/text-proximity`

Detects horizontally adjacent text blocks that are too close together.

### `rules/text-ragged-lines`

Detects awkward ragged/widowed lines in multi-line text blocks.

## Suppressing rules

To ignore a subtree of the DOM, use `data-viewlint-ignore`:

```html
<div data-viewlint-ignore="rules/text-contrast">...</div>
```

Use `data-viewlint-ignore="all"` to suppress all rules inside that subtree.
