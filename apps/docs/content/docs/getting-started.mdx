ViewLint is a tool that helps identify issues in the rendered output of a website.

## Quick Start

Install and configure ViewLint with this command:

```bash tab="NPM"
npm init @viewlint/config@latest
```

```bash tab="PNPM"
pnpm create @viewlint/config@latest
```

```bash tab="Bun"
bun create @viewlint/config@latest
```

```bash tab="Yarn"
yarn create @viewlint/config
```

This will guide you through the creation of a configuration file and help you install the necessary dependencies.

## Run ViewLint

After that, you can run ViewLint on any site like this:

```bash tab="NPM"
npx viewlint https://example.com
```

```bash tab="PNPM"
pnpm dlx viewlint https://example.com
```

```bash tab="Bun"
bunx viewlint https://example.com
```

```bash tab="Yarn"
yarn dlx viewlint https://example.com
```

## Configuration

When you run `npm init @viewlint/config` you'll be asked a series of questions to help you set up your ViewLint configuration.

For example, if you select the base rules, your configuration file will look something like this:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: {
    rules,
  },
  extends: ["rules/recommended"],
});
```

The `rules/recommended` configuration ensures that all the rules marked as recommended on the [rules reference page](/docs/rules-reference) will be enabled. You can configure rules individually by defining a new rules key, as in this example:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: {
    rules,
  },
  extends: ["rules/recommended"],
  rules: {
	"text-contrast": "error",
  }
});
```

The name `"text-contrast"` is the name of a rule in ViewLint.

**Difference from ESLint**: The severity system has been slightly tweaked:

- Severity levels must be a string as defined below. Assigning to `0`, `1`, or `2` do not work.
- Rules now bundle a **Default Severity**. In order to keep the **Default Severity**, you can use the `inherit` level in config.

</Callout>

The value you assign to it is the severity level of the rule. All rules have a severity level out-of-the-box, but you can configure it yourself.

- `off`: Turn off the rule completely
- `inherit`: Continue using the current severity
- `info`: Mark the rule as informational only. Doesn't affect exit code.
- `warn`: Make the rule a warning. Doesn't affect exit code
- `error`: Make the rule an error. Affects exit code when it happens

## Manual Installation

You can also set up ViewLint manually.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Install Packages

Install ViewLint and the built-in rules:

```bash tab="NPM"
npm install --save-dev viewlint@latest @viewlint/rules@latest
```

```bash tab="PNPM"
pnpm add --save-dev viewlint@latest @viewlint/rules@latest
```

```bash tab="Bun"
bun add --dev viewlint@latest @viewlint/rules@latest
```

```bash tab="Yarn"
yarn add --dev viewlint@latest @viewlint/rules@latest
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Add a ViewLint Config File

ViewLint config files can be written in both JS and TS, depending on your project. In this guide, we will use TypeScript

<Callout>
**Difference from ESLint**: Built-in TypeScript

ViewLint has TypeScript built in. That means that configuration files in TypeScript work out-of-the-box. All utility functions including `defineConfig` also are typed for a better DX.

</Callout>

```bash
touch viewlint.config.ts
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Add a Configuration

Add a configuration file to your `viewlint.config.ts`. Refer to [Configure Viewlint](/docs/configure-viewlint) for more information about how to add rules, custom configurations, plugins, and more.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: {
    rules,
  },
  extends: ["rules/recommended"],
  rules: {
	"text-contrast": "error",
  }
});
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Lint with ViewLint CLI

```bash tab="NPM"
npx viewlint https://example.com
```

```bash tab="PNPM"
pnpm dlx viewlint https://example.com
```

```bash tab="Bun"
bunx viewlint https://example.com
```

```bash tab="Yarn"
yarn dlx viewlint https://example.com
```

See the [CLI Reference](/docs/cli-reference) for more information on CLI options.
