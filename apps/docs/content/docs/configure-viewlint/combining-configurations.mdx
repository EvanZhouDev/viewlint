description: Put Together Predefined Configurations

You rarely want to write a full config from scratch.

Instead, you usually:

1. start from a preset (like `rules/recommended`)
2. add your own overrides

## Extend a preset

The built-in rules package (`@viewlint/rules`) ships with two presets:

- `rules/recommended`
- `rules/all`

Here’s a common setup:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: {
    rules,
  },
  extends: ["rules/recommended"],
});
```

## Override after extending

Later config wins.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: {
    rules,
  },
  extends: ["rules/recommended"],
  rules: {
    "rules/text-contrast": "error",
    "rules/text-proximity": "off",
  },
});
```

## Extend config objects directly

If you prefer, you can extend the config objects that a plugin exports:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig([
  rules.configs.recommended,
  {
    rules: {
      "rules/text-contrast": "error",
    },
  },
]);
```

If you’re unsure which style to use, stick with string `extends`.
