title: Combine Configs
description: Put Together Predefined Configurations
---

You rarely want to write a full config from scratch.

Instead, you usually:

1. start from a preset (like `rules/recommended`)
2. add your own overrides

Since ViewLint configurations are just objects, you can always directly compose objects as you would in JavaScript through the spread operator.

## Extend a preset

The extends keyword can be used to include configuration from a plugin.

In order to use it, you can include the name of the preset like `plugin/preset` as shown below with `@viewlint/rules`. `rules/recommended` is the recommended setup exported from `@viewlint/rules`.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: {
		rules,
	},
	extends: ["rules/recommended"],
});
```

Note that the `extends` property is only available whe you use `defineConfig`. However, you can always [extend configuration objects directly](#extend-config-objects-directly).

## Override after extending

The latest configuration takes precedence, meaning you can override configurations you've extended.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: {
		rules,
	},
	extends: ["rules/recommended"],
	rules: {
		"rules/text-contrast": "error",
		"rules/text-proximity": "off",
	},
});
```

## Extend config objects directly

If you prefer, you can extend the config objects that a plugin exports, through pure JavaScript:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig([
	rules.configs.recommended,
	{
		rules: {
			"rules/text-contrast": "error",
		},
	},
]);
```
