title: Configuration Files
description: Edit ViewLint Configuration
---

ViewLint reads its configuration from a file in your project.

## File name

ViewLint looks for one of these files (starting from your current directory and walking upward):

- `viewlint.config.ts`
- `viewlint.config.mjs`
- `viewlint.config.js`

You can also point to a specific file on the CLI:

```bash
viewlint --config path/to/viewlint.config.ts https://example.com
```

## Export shape

Your config file should export either:

- a single config object, or
- an array of config objects

Most projects use the helper from `viewlint/config`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: {
    rules,
  },
  extends: ["rules/recommended"],
});
```

## What can you configure?

At a high level:

- **plugins**: where rules and shared configs come from
- **rules**: what checks run, and how strict they are
- **views**: how to open and prepare the page
- **options**: reusable option layers (like `baseURL`)
- **scopes**: reusable scope roots (what part of the page to lint)

If you’re just getting started, you usually only touch **rules**.
