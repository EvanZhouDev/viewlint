You can put your ViewLint configuration into a file. These include rules, plugins, custom Views, Scopes, and Options.

## Configuration File

ViewLint looks for one of these files (starting from your current directory and walking upward):

- `viewlint.config.ts`
- `viewlint.config.mjs`
- `viewlint.config.js`

You can also point to a specific file on the CLI:

```bash
viewlint --config path/to/viewlint.config.ts https://example.com
```

## Export shape

Your config file exports an array of configuration objects. You can use the `defineConfig` from `viewlint/config` to have type hints and support deeply nested configuration arrays.

Here's an example configuration:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig([
  {
    plugins: {
      rules,
    },
    extends: ["rules/recommended"],
  },
  {
    rules: {
      "text-contrast": "error"
    }
  }
]);
```

## Configuration Objects

Here's a high-level overview of what you can edit. Click on the links to see in more detail how these features work.

- `extends`: An array of strings, configuration objects, or configuration arrays that contain additional configuration to apply. Only available when using `defineConfig`.
- [`rules`](/docs/configure-viewlint/configure-rules): An object containing the configured rules.
- [`plugins`](/docs/configure-plugins): An object containing a name-value mapping of plugin names to plugin objects.
- [`views`](/docs/configure-views): An object containing a name-value mapping of view names to Views, representing preset, reusable views.
- [`options`](/docs/configure-views): An object containing a name-value mapping of option names to Options, representing preset, reusable options.
- [`scopes`](/docs/configure-views): An object containing a name-value mapping of scope names to Scope functions/arrays, representing preset, reusable scopes.
