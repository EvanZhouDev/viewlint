description: Add and Configure ViewLint Rules
---

Rules are what ViewLint runs on a page.

## Rule IDs

Rule IDs look like `pluginNamespace/ruleName`.

For the built-in rules package:

- plugin namespace: `rules`
- rule IDs: like `rules/text-contrast`

## Rule severities

Each rule can be set to one of these severities:

- `"off"`: don’t run the rule
- `"info"`: report as info
- `"warn"`: report as a warning
- `"error"`: report as an error

There’s also `"inherit"`, which means “use the rule’s default severity”.

## Configure a rule

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: {
    rules,
  },
  extends: ["rules/recommended"],
  rules: {
    "rules/text-contrast": "error",
    "rules/text-proximity": "off",
  },
});
```

## Rule options

Some rules accept options.

Those are written as an array:

```ts
rules: {
	"my-plugin/my-rule": ["warn", { /* rule-specific options */ }],
}
```

The available options depend on the rule.

See: [Rules Reference](/docs/rules-reference)

## Suppress a specific UI area

ViewLint supports an HTML escape hatch:

```html
<div data-viewlint-ignore="rules/text-contrast">...</div>
```

Use `data-viewlint-ignore="all"` to suppress all rules inside that subtree.
