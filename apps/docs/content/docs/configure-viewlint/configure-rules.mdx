description: Add and Configure ViewLint Rules
---

Rules report issues that you see with ViewLint. A Rule is a special piece of Playwright code executed by the ViewLint Engine that call a special report function when it detects a specific pattern.

This section focuses on configuring pre-existing rules that have already been loaded from plugins. If you wish to define your own rules, learn more in [Custom Rules Quickstart](/docs/custom-rules-quickstart).

Note that ViewLint comes with [built-in rules](/docs/rules-reference) that you can configure.

## Rule severities

Each rule can be set to one of these severities:

- `"off"`: Don't run the rule
- `"info"`: Report as info (is not incorrect, but may be of interest to the user)
- `"warn"`: Report as a warning (is incorrect, but does not affect exit code)
- `"error"`: Report as an error (exit code is 1 when triggered)

Rules have a default severity, which they can declare in the rule definition. If you wish to keep the severity of the rule when enabling it, you can use the `"inherit"` severity.

## Configure a rule

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: {
    rules,
  },
  extends: ["rules/recommended"],
  rules: {
    "text-contrast": "error",
    "text-proximity": "off",
  },
});
```

## Rule options

Some rules accept options.

Those are written as an array:

```ts
rules: {
	"my-rule": ["warn", { /* rule-specific options */ }],
}
```

The available options depend on the rule.

See: [Rules Reference](/docs/rules-reference)

## Rules from Plugins

To specify a rule that is defined inside a plugin, use the format `pluginNamespace/ruleName`.

The plugin namespace is whatever name you defined in the plugins object.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: {
    myExampleNamespace: rules,
  },
  extends: ["myExampleNamespace/recommended"],
  rules: {
    "myExampleNamespace/text-contrast": "error",
    "myExampleNamespace/text-proximity": "off",
  },
});
```

In this case, we just defined the namespace to be `myExampleNamespace` and we can edit the rule severity there.

## Disabling Rules

There is an escape hatch if you wish to override a rule in your file. In order to do this, we support an HTML attribute called `data-viewlint-ignore`. When ViewLint sees this attribute on an element, the entire subtree will have the rules in `data-viewlint-ignore` suppressed. You can separate multiple rules with spaces.

```html
<div data-viewlint-ignore="rules/text-contrast rules/space-misuse">...</div>
```

Use `data-viewlint-ignore="*"` to suppress all rules inside that subtree.

It is highly recommended you include a `data-viewlint-ignore-reason` or similar tag to make it clear why you decided to suppress the rule.
