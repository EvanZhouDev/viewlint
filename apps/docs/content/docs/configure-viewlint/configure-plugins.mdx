description: Add and Configure ViewLint Plugins
---

Plugins allow you to easily extend ViewLint in a way that scales. Plugins can include:

- Custom Rules to validate your output
- Custom Configurations

This section focuses on how you can install 3rd party (or first party) plugins. If you want to create your own plugins, go to [Create Plugins](/docs/create-plugins)

## Add a plugin

Plugins are simply JavaScript/TypeScript objects.

To use one, import it and put it under `plugins`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: {
    rules,
  },
});
```

The key you choose (`rules` in the example) becomes the **plugin namespace**.

## Local and Virtual Plugins

Since plugins are simply objects, they do not have to be published on NPM to be used. You can always import a local object, or even directly declare the plugin inline. For example:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import myPlugin from "./myPlugin";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: {
    myPlugin,
    anotherPlugin: {
      // Define your Virtual Plugin here
    }
  },
});
```
