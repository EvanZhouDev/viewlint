Scope lets you lint only a part of the page.

It is the "where" of a Target.

By default, ViewLint lints the whole page (`document.body`). Narrowing scope can make linting faster and makes results easier to interpret.

## What is a Scope

A Scope is a function that returns one or more Playwright locators.

Those locators become the "roots" of linting. Rules only search inside those roots.

## One-off scope in CLI

If you just want to focus on a region, use ad-hoc CSS selectors:

```bash
viewlint https://example.com --selector "#checkout" ".modal"
```

Each selector adds another root.
If all selectors resolve to zero elements, ViewLint exits with code `2`.

Tip: if you pass URLs and `--selector`, put the URLs first.

## Reusable scopes in config

For repeatable workflows, define named scopes in `viewlint.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "viewlint/config";
import rules from "@viewlint/rules";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: { rules },
  extends: ["rules/recommended"],

  scopes: {
    checkout: {
      getLocator: ({ page }) => page.locator("#checkout"),
    },
  },
});
```

Then run:

```bash
viewlint https://example.com --scope checkout
```

If the named scope resolves to zero elements, ViewLint exits with code `2`.

### Scopes can return multiple roots

If your UI is split across multiple areas, return multiple locators:

```ts
scopes: {
	importantStuff: {
		getLocator: ({ page }) => [
			page.locator("header"),
			page.locator("#checkout"),
		],
	},
}
```

## Composing scopes

You can apply more than one scope in a single run. ViewLint will combine all of their roots.

```bash
viewlint https://example.com --scope checkout importantStuff
```

## Scope vs ignoring

- Use scope when you want ViewLint to focus on a region.
- Use `data-viewlint-ignore` when you want to silence a subtree even when linting the whole page.
