title: Ways to Extend ViewLint
description: Modify ViewLint with Custom Plugins, Rules, and Configs

There are a few common ways teams extend ViewLint.

The best path depends on what you are trying to do: tune what checks run, add new checks, or integrate ViewLint into a bigger workflow.

## Customize your config

This includes:

- Turning rules on/off
- Integrating pre-built plugins or rules
- Add named Option layers, Scopes, and Views.

- [Configure ViewLint](/docs/configure-viewlint)
- [Configure Rules](/docs/configure-viewlint/configure-rules)
- [Configure Views](/docs/configure-viewlint/configure-views)
- [Configure Scope](/docs/configure-viewlint/configure-scope)

## Write a plugin (Custom Rules + Presets)

If you need checks that are specific to your UI or design system, you'll need to create a plugin.

- [Custom Rules Quickstart](/docs/create-plugins/custom-rules-quickstart)

## Build a Custom Workflow

If you want to run ViewLint programmatically (CI pipelines, custom tooling, and scripts), you'll need to use the TypeScript API.

## Use the MCP server

If you want an Agent to run ViewLint easily as a tool, use the MCP server.
