description: Extends ViewLint with Custom Plugins
---

Plugins are how you can extend ViewLint. While there are pre-built plugins, including ViewLint's own `@viewlint/rules`, sometimes you want to build your own plugins.

Most plugins provide two things:

- New rules
- Reusable configuration presets (Configs you can `extends`)

If you want ViewLint to catch something specific to your product or design system, a plugin is usually the right tool.

- Check that UI is following your design system
- Check for interactions specific to your website

If you are trying to solve a one-off problem, you can often start with a custom View or Scope instead. Plugins are best when you want a check you can reuse and share.
