title: Missing Browser Executable
description: Why does ViewLint fail with browserType.launch Executable doesn't exist?
---

ViewLint requires a Playwright Chromium browser to be installed before it can run.

You can install the browser as such, or with your preferred package manager:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

Note that if you use `npm init @viewlint/config`, it will ask you whether you wish to install the browser.
